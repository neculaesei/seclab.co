# My personal website

I built this while playing with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/).

## Cloning and starting the server

```shell
git clone git@github.com:neculaesei/seclab.co.git seclab
cd seclab
harp server .
# Visit localhost:9000
```

## Compiling to a static site

```shell
harp compile .
# Static files will be generated in the www folder
```
